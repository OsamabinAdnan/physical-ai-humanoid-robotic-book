## Prompt

```text
I want to write a Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book using Spec-Kit Plus, Claude CLI, and Docusaurus.
Before I write the formal spec, help me think through:

1. What key topics in "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" should I focus on?
2. Who is the target audience for this book?
3. What does a successful outcome for this book look like?
4. What constraints, risks, or edge cases should I keep in mind?
```

## Response snapshot

```text
I have now covered all four points you asked for in detail.

To recap, we've discussed:

1.  **Key Topics**: A comprehensive list ranging from foundational concepts and hardware to perception, cognition, control, ethical considerations, and future trends in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
2.  **Target Audience**: Defined as advanced undergraduate/graduate students, researchers, and professional engineers in related fields, with specific educational backgrounds and learning goals.
3.  **Successful Outcome**: Outlined through educational impact, technical authority and reliability, innovation and future-proofing, and internal project success metrics.
4.  **Constraints, Risks, & Edge Cases**: Identified challenges such as rapid obsolescence, hardware-dependent reproducibility, computational resource demands, book scope, factual accuracy, and ethical considerations.

Please take a moment to review this comprehensive overview. Do you have any feedback on these points, or would you like to refine any of them before we move on to drafting the formal specification for your book?
