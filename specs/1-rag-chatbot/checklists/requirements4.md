# Specification Quality Checklist: Frontend and Backend Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to implementation
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Feature**: [Link to spec4-frontend-backend-integration.md](../spec4-frontend-backend-integration.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification
- [X] Architecture decisions are documented in the plan
- [X] Tasks are broken down into testable units

## Implementation Validation

- [X] Plan addresses all functional requirements from spec
- [X] Technical approach in plan aligns with constraints
- [X] Success criteria from spec are addressed in tasks
- [X] User scenarios are covered by user story tasks
- [X] Edge cases from spec are addressed in implementation tasks
- [X] Dependencies identified in spec are accounted for in plan

## Notes

- All items validated successfully
- Specification, plan, and tasks are aligned and ready for implementation
- Frontend-backend integration approach is clearly defined with floating chat interface and selected text functionality
